# Timetable Scheduling

Timetable scheduling is a complex and challenging problem, especially in educational institutions where multiple constraints must be balanced. The goal is to create a timetable that assigns classes, teachers, and rooms to specific time slots, ensuring that all necessary conditions are met.

## Constraint Satisfaction Problem

The timetable scheduling problem can be viewed as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP), where the objective is to find a solution that satisfies a set of constraints. These constraints can be broadly categorized into two types:

1. **Correctness Requirements:**

   - Every lesson must be scheduled exactly once.
   - No teacher or student group should have overlapping classes.
   - Rooms must be allocated efficiently without conflicts.

2. **Comfort Requirements:**
   - Preferences for teaching hours.
   - Minimizing the number of working days for teachers.
   - Avoiding long stretches of consecutive classes.

## Approach

Approach involves converting the timetable scheduling problem into a SAT (Satisfiability) problem, which can be efficiently solved using the Z3 SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solver. Here's how it works:

1. **Custom Query Language:** We developed a user-friendly query language that allows users to define their scheduling constraints. This language serves as the interface between the userâ€™s requirements and the underlying SAT problem.

2. **Constraint Encoding:** The user-defined constraints are translated into propositional logic, resulting in a conjunctive normal form (CNF) formula. This formula represents the scheduling problem in a form that the Z3 solver can process.

3. **Z3 Solver:** The Z3 solver is then used to find solutions that satisfy the CNF formula. These solutions correspond to valid timetables that meet all the defined constraints.

## Use Cases

1. **University Timetabling:**

   - **Scenario:** A university needs to schedule classes across different departments.
   - **Solution:** Define constraints to avoid class overlaps and generate a valid timetable.

2. **Meeting Scheduling for Corporates:**

   - **Scenario:** A corporate office needs to schedule meetings for multiple teams
   - **Solution:** Define constraints like no overlapping meetings for key participants
